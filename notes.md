# Notes
These are notes, I took after my project has been finished and checked the solution video, to learn and improve.

Multiline editing:
    If I want to edit multiple line with the same you can use a short cut. eg. for 3 line you want to insert # in front.
    You can press and hold: 
        - In Mac: Option + Shift
        - In Windows: CTRL + Shift
    Then select the lines

Can already calculate the Totel when gettgin the user input by multipling th evalue and adding it to the Sum variable

Instead of formating the change, you can also use the `round()` function.
